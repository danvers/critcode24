## Introduction

Welcome to the critcode24 repository! This project is dedicated to providing examples and snippets for the introduction course on Critical Code Studies (CCS) at Bielefeld University 2024. The goal is to discuss methodological approaches to analyzing code and to explore the social, cultural, and political implications of software development. Educational resources, code examples, and research projects are included in this repository. For educational science, computer science, and digital humanities students, this repository serves as a resource for learning about critical code studies.

For more information on critical code studies, see the following resources: criticalcodestudies.com, the Critical Code Studies Working Groups (https://wg.criticalcodestudies.com/).

About the course: The course "Introduction to Critical Code Studies" is an introduction to the field of Critical Code Studies (CCS) and explores the social, cultural, and political implications of software development. The course covers topics such as code analysis, software studies, digital humanities, and critical theory. Students will learn how to analyze code from a critical perspective and engage with the broader implications of software development. The course is designed for students in educational science, computer science, and digital humanities who are interested in exploring the intersection of technology and society.

## Getting Started

```

## Examples

The repository collects examples and snippets of code that can be found in the [Introduction into Critical Code Studies](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262043656/critical-code-studies/) by [Mark Marino](https://github.com/markcmarino). Additionally, the repository includes examples from the seminar "Introduction to Critical Code Studies" at Bielefeld University 2024. These examples are rooted in the tradition of CCS and explore the social, cultural, and political implications of software development. The folder critique-praxis refers to the idea of coding praxis as discussed by [Geoff Cox, Alex McLean Adrian Ward (2004)](https://monoskop.org/File:Cox_McLean_Ward_2004_Coding_Praxis_Reconsidering_the_Aesthetics_of_Code.pdf)
Here are some snippets included in this repository:

- **Example 1:** A variation of 10 Print in Python
- **Example 2:** Examination of the job interview example in Python
- **Example 3:** Fibonacci sequence in Python
