## Introduction

Welcome to the critcode24 repository! This project is dedicated to providing examples and snippets for the introduction course on Critical Code Studies (CCS) at Bielefeld University 2024. The goal is to discuss methodological approaches to analyzing code and to explore the social, cultural, and political implications of software development. Educational resources, code examples, and research projects are included in this repository. For educational science, computer science, and digital humanities students, this repository serves as a resource for learning about critical code studies.

For more information on critical code studies, see the following resources: criticalcodestudies.com, the Critical Code Studies Working Groups (https://wg.criticalcodestudies.com/).
